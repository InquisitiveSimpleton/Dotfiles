        Packages:
            Exa;
            Note taking app that use vim? or note taking app the can save txt.;

    Research:

        HOW DO USE  IF IN BASH WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GUESS?

        Why do you get the binary by dividing 2 and making odd as o - 1 and it is 1 and also why the power learncpp func bit method?;

        What is compound?

        Is it okay to save note.txt in git?

        What is __base in strtol?;

        learn more about hexadecimal and binary;

        Find out time complexity of primal beast or what is the time complexity
            of O(n) function executed for each loop of n or check every digit if its prime in 100;

        add ccls to home not just git/practice;

        Function takes specific multiple types like int or string or double C++;

        Put this note on git; Read more about I/O stream manipulators;

        how does setpricision and boolalpha work; stream manipulators;

        Can you do stuff without monitor like moving mouse or not? stream how to initialize input stream as argument; 

        char* vs char C++;

        is unordered_set faster?;

        stream buffers;

        Parent[PimageBridgeParent];

        is std::string actually 32 bytes or 256 bits?;

        what inbuilt algorithm does C++ use for calculator;


    Websites:
        Regex: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2811031/decimal-or-numeric-values-in-regular-expression-validation;

        https://learnxinyminutes.com/;

        Standard revision cppreference;

To do:

    Will take long:

        Make your calculator as object and symbolic calculation.;

        garbage collector in calc.;

        Learn C++ and C#;

        GHB;

        Learn about networking as much as a possible

        Decompile raot it is il2cpp

        Reverse engineer Roblox extensions of how they get regional servers

        Learn HTML, JS, CSS, API's.

        Start Khan Academy after we get internet;

    Not that long:

        Detect if input is int or floating point and make seperate evaluator for them to reduce rounding error with: only if operator is * + - ^
        or use templates to accept multiple type

        Why do you get the binary by dividing 2 and making odd as o - 1 and it is 1 and also why the power learncpp func bit method?;

        Add remainder or modulu operator but % is taken so r symbol;

        Make a bash script to make backup of this note everytime it saved with logs and old_bak up to 20;

        Sync all git files or anything that can be sync if we have reasonable internet.;
        
        Do the updates in next holiday either with offline or thether;

        Make the collage cutout project

Reminder:

    Do your module when it arrives;

    Better to read just docs than tutorials;

    Practice on Codewars?, Leetcode, ProjectEuler everyday.;

    Check leaks;

    Start Khan Academy after we get internet;

    Cron to run processes scheduly;

Commands;

    Use these flags when compiling with g++: -pedantic-errors -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Werror -Wsign-conversion -std=c++20;

    wget -r -N -k -p -t 0 -l 2 -w 1 -E -I /cpp-tutorial/ -X "*" https://www.learncpp.com/;//this lack image when downloaded
