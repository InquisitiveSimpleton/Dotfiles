    Research:

        HOW DO USE  IF IN BASH WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GUESS?

        Why do you get the binary by dividing 2 and making odd as o - 1 and it is 1 and also why the power learncpp func bit method?;

        What is __base in strtol?;

        learn more about hexadecimal and binary;
   
        add ccls to home not just git/practice;

        Function takes specific multiple types like int or string or double C++;

        Put this note on git; Read more about I/O stream manipulators;

        how does setpricision and boolalpha work; stream manipulators;

        Can you do stuff without monitor like moving mouse or not? stream how to initialize input stream as argument; 

        char* vs char C++;

        is unordered_set faster?;

        stream buffers;

        Parent[PimageBridgeParent];

        is std::string actually 32 bytes or 256 bits?;

        what inbuilt algorithm does C++ use for calculator;

        garbage collector in calc.;

        Learn C++ and C#;

        GHB;

        Learn about networking as much as a possible;

        Decompile raot it is il2cpp;

        Reverse engineer Roblox extensions of how they get regional servers;

        Learn HTML, JS, CSS, API's.;

        Start Khan Academy after we get internet;

	Reverse engineer roblox injectors;

    Not that long:

        Detect if input is int or floating point and make seperate evaluator for them to reduce rounding error with: only if operator is * + - ^
        or use templates to accept multiple type

        Why do you get the binary by dividing 2 and making odd as o - 1 and it is 1 and also why the power learncpp func bit method?;

        Add remainder or modulu operator but % is taken so r symbol;

        Make a bash script to make backup of this note everytime it saved with logs and old_bak up to 20;

        Sync all git files or anything that can be sync if we have reasonable internet.;

Reminder:

    Make snotenjoyer email and delete any association with snot and LLML like V3rmillion

    Read Synapse X docs;

    Do your module when it arrives;

    Better to read just docs than tutorials;

    Practice on Codewars?, Leetcode, ProjectEuler everyday.;

    Check leaks;

    Start Khan Academy after we get internet;

    Cron to run processes scheduly;

Commands;

    //Windows
    Event id: 1074; //for shutdown and restart
	      6005; //for poweron
	      6008l //for unexpected showdown
	

    powercgf /sleepstudy; //Windows to see power behavior

    Use these flags when compiling with g++: -pedantic-errors -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Werror -Wsign-conversion -std=c++20;
